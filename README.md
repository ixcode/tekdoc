# TEKDOC - the architectural documentation facility


SOme new stuff


This project is an attempt to make a configurable (in terms of style) but consistent generator for web sites that describe architectures.

It's mostly a static site generator based around markdown, but it has some core concepts within it that are specific to architecture documentation so its not so generic.
