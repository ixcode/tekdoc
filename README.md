# TEKDOC - the architectural documentation facility

This project is an attempt to make a configurable (in terms of style) but consistent generator for web sites that describe architectures.

It's mostly a static site generator based around markdown, but it has some core concepts within it that are specific to architecture documentation so its not so generic.

# TODO

- Convert inline markdown references to be "html" that way they will work when viewed in github and on the site.
- Provide a way to deep link to a location in another md file - e.g. glossaries
- Provide a glossary concept so you don't have to build the link manually for every word you want to glossarise.
